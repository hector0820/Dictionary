## Python WebScrap Dictionary

At the moment I'm working on this project. This retrieve word meaning from a web dictionary and then save it into a sqlite databate. 

I want to scale this project, using Pyside6 to develop a graphic interface, and a way to see all words into the database. 

--- 

The word information is

- Word
- Meaning
- Spanish translation
- Four sentences as example
- The translation to spanish of that four translations

---

- [x] `FindingMeaning` retrieves the word information 
- [x] `DataBase` saves the data into the sqlite database.
